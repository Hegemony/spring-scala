Spring Scala
============

This **private** repository is a playground area for Spring Scala, a potential new Spring portfolio project that aims to provide a first-class Spring experience in the Scala language. We are currently investigating whether such a project would make sense, and the code contained herein is simply used to try out some features.

As such, **this project and repository is considered to be confidential**, at least until the decision has been made to go ahead with the project.
So please do not talk about Spring Scala with non-SpringSource personnel for now; the last thing we want is for people to get excited about something we might not ship.

For more information, please refer to [the wiki](https://wiki.springsource.com/display/~apoutsma/Spring+Scala).
